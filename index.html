                <p>Trouble at T2 Campus. A new week brought yet another assignment. This time about CSS animations.</p>
                <p>Our heroes of Holberton are struggling. The keyframes are strong and the amount of worstenbroodjes too small.</p>
                <p>The old structures of knowledge, CV and VCard, have fallen. There is no room for escape, only to fight.</p>
